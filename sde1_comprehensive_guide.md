## 🧠 Behavioral Interviews (HR Round)
Don't ignore this! Companies like Amazon and Google value this as much as coding.

### The STAR Method
Answer behavioral questions using this structure:
1. **S - Situation:** Describe the context/challenge.
2. **T - Task:** What was your role/goal?
3. **A - Action:** What specific steps did **YOU** take?
4. **R - Result:** What was the outcome? (Use numbers if possible: "Improved speed by 20%").

**Common Questions:**
- Tell me about a time you faced a technical challenge.
- Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a team member.
- Why do you want to join us?
